/*Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game 
that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data 
in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.*/

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT);
    
CREATE TABLE tweets (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    date TEXT,
    content TEXT
    );
    
/* After user submitted their tweet */

INSERT INTO tweets (user_id, date, content) VALUES (1, "2023-05-01",
    "I'd like to give a shout out to chocolate milk.");
    
INSERT INTO tweets (user_id, date, content) VALUES (1, "2023-05-02",
    "I love Harry Styles!");

SELECT * FROM tweets;

UPDATE tweets SET content = "I'd like to give a shout out to chocolate" WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM tweets;

DELETE FROM tweets WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM tweets;
